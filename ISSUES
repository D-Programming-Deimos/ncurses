Mouse Events:
	This one is a little tricky since most of this is system specific...
	Some of the functions haven't been implemented yet...

Other Files:
	There are several other files listed in the include/ncurses folder.  things like termcap.h and a few that
	look to be higher-level wrappers..  How much should be included?
