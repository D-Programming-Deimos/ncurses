ACS_vars:
	They do not currently match the C version, but I think that this is as close as we can get.
	See examples/acs_vars.d to see how they are to be used. If this changes, I'll simply deprecate the old way.

Mouse Events:
	This one is a little tricky since most of this is system specific... 
	Some of the functions haven't been implemented yet...

Other Files:
	There are several other files listed in the include/ncurses folder.  things like termcap.h and a few that 
	look to be higher-level wrappers..  How much should be included?
