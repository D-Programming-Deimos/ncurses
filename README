This is currently in BETA.

There will be bugs.  This is simply too large of a library for me to test every single thing.
If you have any trouble, or think that something should be fixed, create a bug report and I'll get right on it.

WARNINGS:
	This should work for most of your needs, however there are still one or two more things that need to be done.
	I plan on having those completed in the next few days.
	I'm actually not entirely sure what still needs to be done.  Someone told me that this was a macro library.
	They were right.  about 90% of it is code for backwards compatibility.  It is a bit challenging to figure out
	what is compatibility and what is actually needed.

	I'll continue to get the other headers translated, things like termcap.h will be added soon.
	I simply need more eyes on this to bug check and ensure that things are working properly.

If you are familiar with the FREE acronym(Functional, Reliable, Elegant, Efficient) I would say we are an F.
I doubt we can get any farther than FR, but let's go for it!
