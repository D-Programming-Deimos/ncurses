This is currently in BETA.

There will be bugs.  This is simply too large of a library for me to test every single thing.
If you have any trouble, or think that something should be fixed, create a bug report and I'll get right on it.

WARNINGS:
	ACS vars currently break from the norm, I'm looking into int, but I'm not sure if It can
	be done exactly the same that C does it.
	instead of writing "addch(ACS_ULCORNER);", Instead write "addch(acs_map[ACS.ULCORNER]);".

	The problem lies with the fact that I'm not sure how to recreate the preprocessor commands.
	It's definitely possible, but It might not be possible at compile time. It might 
	require highjacking the init() function in order to set it up.

	This should work for most of your needs, however there are still one or two more things that need to be done.
	I plan on having those completed in the next few days.
	I'm actually not entirely sure what still needs to be done.  Someone told me that this was a macro library.
	They were right.  about 90% of it is code for backwards compatibility.  It is a bit challenging to figure out
	what is compatibility and what is actually needed.

	I'll continue to get the other headers translated, things like termcap.h will be added soon.
	I simply need more eyes on this to bug check and ensure that things are working properly.

	If you are familiar with the FREE acronym(Functional, Reliable, Elegant, Efficient) I would say we are an F.
	I doubt we can get any farther than FR, but let's go for it!
