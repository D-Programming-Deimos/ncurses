/**  hello_unicode.d
 *
 * This is a demonstration of Unicode output with ncurses in D.
 *
 * The functionality of this code is otherwise identical to hello_world.d
 *
 * Requirements for Unicode in ncurses:
 *  - You need to link against ncursesw instead of ncurses.  If you don't have ncursesw, rebuild
 *    ncurses with --enable-widec (and file a bug with your distro where applicable).
 *  - You need to be using a Unicode locale. If your $LANG looks something like `en_US.utf8`,
 *    then you're in good shape.  Keep in mind that users don't like when you force a locale; do
 *    it only if you think it's really necessary.
